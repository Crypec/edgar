# Edgar

![stack based calculator](./resources/rpn.png)


Edgar is a probably the simplest stack based calculator which can be implemented without the use of a single goto statement. Currently it only supports the most basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

It was intended as a fun little project done in one evening and should be considered as such. There was no consideration for the user experience. (Maybe you should try to see what happens if you try to divide by 0 ;) 

## Installation

You need to install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to try out Edgar. After that you can simply execute 

```bash
cargo run
```
in the project folder to run Edgar.
